                Giorgio Mortara (Matua, 1885 - Rio de Janeiro, 1967) was an Italian-Brazilian economist and demographer. During 1924-38, he taught at Bocconi University in Milan. In 1939, he emigrated to Rio de Janeiro to escape the fascist Racial Laws. Hired by the newly founded IBGE (Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics), he worked as technical advisor on the 1940 Brazilian National Census. He started the IBGE&apos;s Laboratory of Statistics and is regarded as the founder of modern demographic analysis in Brazil. Except for a four-year stint at the Sapienza University of Rome (1956-60), he lived in Rio until the end of his life.
